# Atelier project 2020 - 2021

I did this project in school. The main purpose of this project was to learn how to
make an Android application.

The application asks you different questions, and you have to answer them. If you answer enough
questions, it will find the fruit you are thinking of.

There is also a dataset about dinosaurs. You can ask questions about dinosaurs, and it will find the
dinosaur you are thinking of.
